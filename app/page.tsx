        <p className='mt-4'>My coding journey started when I was a student at the Informatics Engineering Program Universitas Negeri Surabaya. Both basic programming and data structure were two subjects that I didn't like. Now it seems that I have to pay by learning them by myself. My friends who have been exposed to programming science in vocational schools have helped me a lot in learning basic programming materials. I have to thank them a lot for their help.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">The covid pandemic brought me to a different chapter, where lectures were held online so I had a lot of free time because the time spent meeting friends and going out was limited. I spent a lot of time with my family at home and learned to learn coding by utilizing resources on the internet.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">In my 5th semester, I got the opportunity from the Ministry of Education and Culture to join an intensive software development learning program at Dicoding. I gained a lot of knowledge, skills and new friends there. Then in the 6th semester I did an internship program at blibli.com for a year.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">After graduating from college, I had to move to Jakarta to work as a fullstack developer until today. at the beginning, I felt sad because I had to leave my friends and family. however, now, I'm still sad :( hahaha no, kidding, now it's a bit easier because some of my friends also moved to Jakarta. So if you're reading this, please be my friend ðŸ˜…</p>
        <p className="mt-4">i'm still learning programming skills. the difference is, currently I am trying to glance at interests in other fields such as management and business. although, I guess, in the end I will still lean more on programming hahaha.</p>
